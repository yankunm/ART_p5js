Implementation of Path Finding Algorithms in an Aesthetic way.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Look at every possible path and try to find the optimal one.

## A* Path Finding Algorithm

Heuristics - educative guess - This route is probably the best

## Implementation

2D Grid that stores every possible pixel.

The difference between *var* and *let/const* in JavaScript: *var* is **function-scoped**, where *let/const* is **block-scoped**.

Also don't use *var* because it attaches to the **window** object in your browser.
